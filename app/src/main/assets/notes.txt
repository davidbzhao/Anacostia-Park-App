different scenarios

location changed, new zone, not paused, not playing audio, first time playing audio (Your previous zone's audio has finished playing)
location changed, new zone, not paused, playing audio, first time playing audio (Your previous zone's audio is still playing)
location changed, new zone, paused, not playing audio, first time playing audio (The user paused the previous zone's audio)
location changed, new zone, paused, playing audio, first time playing audio (should not happen)
location changed, new zone, not paused, not playing audio, not first time playing audio (Your previous zone's audio has finished playing for another time)
location changed, new zone, not paused, playing audio, not first time playing audio (Your previous zone's audio is playing again)
location changed, new zone, paused, not playing audio, not first time playing audio (The user paused the previous zone's audio on its nth run)
location changed, new zone, paused, playing audio, not first time playing audio (should not happen)


once a user manually clicks pause, automated audio tour is paused
what if a user accidentally clicks play/pause after nth run
- so if a user pauses on a nonfirst time, then continue audio tour

Your previous zone's audio has finished playing => change audio
Your previous zone's audio is still playing => wait to change audio
The user paused the previous zone's audio => change audio, but don't play
Your previous zone's audio has finished playing for another time => change audio
Your previous zone's audio is playing again => wait to change audio
The user paused the previous zone's audio on its nth run => change audio
