    <string name="aws_purpose">
        The Anacostia Watershed Society was founded in 1989
        by a small group of concerned individuals who decided
        that the environmental needs of the Anacostia River
        and its watershed communities required serious attention.
        Over the past 20 years, our staff and programming efforts
        have expanded significantly to encompass efforts
        in environmental education, stewardship, and recreation,
        as well as engaging the community through public affairs.
        We are making a difference and we hope you\'ll help!</string>

        and its watershed communities by cleaning the water,
        recovering the shores, and honoring the heritage.

    <string name="aws_vision">
        The vision is to make the Anacostia River and its
        tributaries swimmable and fishable, in keeping
        with the Clean Water Act, for the health
        and enjoyment of everyone in the community. Community
        involvement is critical to achieving this vision
        and AWS seeks win-win solutions through strong
        partnerships and coalitions, with all parts
        of the community, government, and other stakeholders.
        Core to our work is reaching out to, educating
        and engaging the next generation of decision-makers, our youth.
