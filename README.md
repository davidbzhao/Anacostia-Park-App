# Anacostia Park App
A geonarrative audio tour app

Normally, audio tour guides require you to punch in a number into a device. However, with this geonarrative audio tour guide app,
instead of punching in a number, your phone triggers audio based off of your GPS location. This allows for a completely hands-free
tour guide experience.

Although originally intended for the Anacostia Park, the project has transformed into creating a framework for a geonarrative audio
app. An audio tour on your phone could be used at many sites such as college campuses or historical cities.

## Inspiration

This was my senior lab project for the Web/Android app development senior lab at TJHSST.
